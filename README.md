Additional, installing Insomnia is recommended for exploring the CRUD functionality of this application. [Insomnia Download](https://insomnia.rest/download)

Once the required software has been successfully installed on the computer, clone this GitHub repository to a desired folder on the computer.

[The GitHub Repository of this Social Network Application](https://github.com/Hello-AndyJoe/Challenge-18-Social-Network)

The cloned repository does not include the node_module folder containing the Express or Mongoose NPMs. Install them into the repository by running `npm i` in a GitBash terminal within Visual Studio Code. 


## Usage

Open a GitBash Terminal within the cloned repository and run `npm start`.

Then you can open `http://localhost:3001/api/users` or `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts` in Insomnia. The following video will showcase the use of the CRUD functionality.
